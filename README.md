# Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides information and a formula for calculating simple interest. Simple interest is a quick and easy method of calculating the interest charge on a loan.

## Formula
The formula for calculating simple interest is:
**SI = (P × R × T) / 100**

### Variables:
- **P** = Principal amount (the initial amount of money)
- **R** = Annual interest rate (in percentage)
- **T** = Time period (in years)

## Example
If you borrow $1,000 (P) at an annual interest rate of 5% (R) for 2 years (T), the simple interest (SI) would be:
SI = (1000 * 5 * 2) / 100 = $100
